This project demonstrates a real-time object detection system that runs entirely inside a web browser using ML5.js and the COCO-SSD model. Without any external software installation, the system accesses your device's camera, detects common objects in real-time, and displays bounding boxes with confidence scores on-screen.

The goal of this project is to make modern AI-based object detection accessible, lightweight, and easy to deploy using just HTML, JavaScript, and browser APIs.
